# EA_CVD_RISK

Repo consists of:
1) 3 Python notebooks used to train each of the 7 touchscreen + multiomics + clinical indicators models (First three, middle two, last two)
2) Our final implementation of the evolutionary algorithm that determined the risk thresholds used to classify samples


Our Modelling Consisted of Several Steps 
1) Benchmarking between risk stratification frameworks,
2) Feature selection using mRMR
3) Training of risk strattification based on sub categories
4) Design of Evoutionary Algorithm to design risk thresholds
5) Benchmarking of individual models and EA against existing risk prediction models
